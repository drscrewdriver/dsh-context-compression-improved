# dsh-context-compression-improved-runtime

Internal runtime package for the unofficial community Bundle [`dsh-context-compression-improved`](https://github.com/WilliamShi666/dsh-context-compression-improved). Most users should install the Bundle, not this package directly.

It provides deterministic Fresh, Aggregate, History, Native tool-result, and Custom TailTrim compression; a plugin-owned `context_compression_retrieve` recovery tool; structured audit records; and a pinned offline DeepSeek V4 tokenizer. It uses only public DeepSeek Harness APIs and supports both `0.1.1-rc.2` and `0.1.2-alpha.5`; it does not patch Harness core.

Lossy rewrites require exact same-revision counts before and after replacement. Verified model ids are `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, and `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp`. Vision text counting uses the separately pinned `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp` tokenizer. Vision images use the official image-processor arithmetic validated against official golden fixtures and are reported as `tokenizer-estimate`: the four alignment residues over valid intrinsic dimensions are collapsed to their midpoint, with 384 tokens retained as the per-image upper bound; malformed or unevaluable dimensions use a fixed 256-token fallback. The estimate is not exact because the absolute prompt position and the adapter's final image projection are not publicly observable. Image-bearing tool-result candidates remain exact-ineligible and intact; unknown models, unavailable tokenizer assets, unsafe tool groups, and incomplete text measurements still fail open.

Audit log records use the prefix `context-compression audit ` and distinguish policy snapshots, skipped/disabled components, committed rewrites, fail-open errors, and observed core `compaction/summary` events. No audit record contains prompt or tool-result content.

The first `policy-frozen` record carries the complete settings/deployment snapshot. It is emitted through the Harness logger, so its retention follows the configured log sink; standard prune/replacement Session events remain the durable proof of committed rewrites. This package does not hard-code a private path below `~/.dsh`.
