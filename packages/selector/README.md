# dsh-context-compression-improved

The installable Product Bundle for the unofficial community DeepSeek Harness context-compression selector.

**0.1.0 highlights:** DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision's official tokenizer is included; users can choose the model-driven Auto Compact threshold; standard profile watermarks and compression parameters follow that choice.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-context-compression-improved@latest
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

This one command installs the single `dsh-context-compression-improved` package: the compression
runtime, the Host settings, the Web UI and the reversible preset overlay all ship in it.
The Bundle contributes Host settings, the Web UI, and a reversible preset overlay. All presets
except the exact built-in `minimal` id receive the compression stack; switching non-Minimal
presets preserves the saved selector settings. Minimal pauses plugin compression without
deleting the setting.

Verified compatibility: DeepSeek Harness `dsh-v0.1.1-rc.2` and `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.5`, Node `^22.19.0 || >=24`. No Harness core patch is required.
